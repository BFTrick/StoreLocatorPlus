Store Locator Plus is based on the popular Google Maps Store Locator with a few customizations we needed for our clients. Unfortunately the original author is on haitus, so we've had to create our ownupdate. Hopefully other WordPress users will find our additions useful.

== Description ==

= Provides Mapping, Display, and Search of Locations For: =
* Those of you who create sites for clients using WordPress
* Those of you who want to show your important locations (stores, buildings, points of interest, etc.) in an easily searchable manner.

Also referred to as a dealer locator (locater), shop finder, and zip code or zipcode search.
Its strength is in its flexibility to allow you to easily manage a few or a thousand or more locations through the admin interface.

= Great Built-In Functionality & Features =
* You can use it for numerous countries, which will continue to be added as Google adds new countries to their Google Maps API.  See the documentation for the latest
* Supports international languages and character sets 
* Allows you to use unique map icons or your own custom map icons --- great for branding your map
* Gives your map the desired look by using our Map Designer&trade; interface in the WordPress admin section
* Pick other cool Google Maps options, such as an inset box, zoom level, map types (street, satellite, hybrid, physical), and more
* You can use miles or kilometers
* Automatically restricts loading of Javascript & CSS to only pages that display the map (or that might need access to the JS & CSS) for better site performance
* Option to show dropdown list of cities allows visitors to quickly see where your locations are and choose their search accordingly

= Upgrades =

== Installation ==

= Main Plugin =

1. Upload the `store-locator-plus` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Sign up for a Google Maps API Key for your domain at http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html
4. Add your locations through the 'Add Locations' page in the Store Locator admin panel
5. Place the code '[STORE-LOCATOR]' (case-sensitive) in the body of a page or a post to display your store locator

= Addons =

1. Unzip & Upload the entire add-on folder to the `/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/addons` directory.
2. Activate the add-on by updating the Activation Key that you receive after purchase at the bottom of the "News & Upgrades" Page.

= Themes =

1. Unzip & Upload the entire theme folder to the `wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/themes` directory.
2. Select theme from the theme dropdown menu under the "Design" section on the "Map Designer"&trade; Page.

= Icons =

1. There are some default icons in the `/wp-content/plugins/store-locator/icons` directory. 
2. Add your own custom icons in to `wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/custom-icons`.

= Custom CSS (Stylesheet) =

You can modify the default 'store-locator.css' and place it under `/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/custom-css/`. The store locator will give priority to the 'store-locator.css' in the 'custom-css/' folder over the default 'store-locator.css' in the main 'store-locator/' folder. This allows you to upgrade the main store locator plugin without worrying about losing your custom styling. 

== Changelog ==

= 1.3  (December 2010) =

* Initial release based on Google Maps Store Locator for WordPress v1.2.39.3
* Add country field to the address
